## promnesia

This lets me use [my own HPI modules](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI) as additional `Source`s for [promnesia](https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia).

It indexes any URLs it finds in:

- Discord messages, [parsed from the data export](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/discord_data)
- Additional browser history from my [ffexport](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/ffexport) (firefox) backups
- Podcasts/Videos I watched with mpv (tracked by [this](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/mpv-history-daemon))
- comments from some [old forums](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/forum_parser) I used to be on
- Youtube videos/comments [parsed](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI/tree/master/my/google) from my [google takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
- Movies/TV Show episodes tracked by my [trakt](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/traktexport)
- Shell histories (zsh, [ttt](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/ttt))
- SMS history, using [SMSBackupRestore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&hl=en_US)
- Git commits on my system
