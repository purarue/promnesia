## promnesia

This lets me use [my own HPI modules](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI) as additional `Source`s for [promnesia](https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia). Adds:

- Any links I sent in discord messages
- Additional browser history from my [ffexport](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/ffexport) (firefox) backups
- Any podcasts/videos I watched with mpv (tracked by [this](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/mpv-history-daemon))
- Some links from some [old forums](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/forum_parser)
- My Google Takeout - Youtube Comments/Videos
- Anything tracked by my [trakt](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/traktexport) (Movies, Episodes)
- Any URLs in my shell histories (zsh, [ttt](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/ttt))
